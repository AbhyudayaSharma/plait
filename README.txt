This is the "plait" package, which implements the Plait language as
used with

 #lang plait
 ....


The package is meant to be installed with the Racket package manager:

 * In recent versions of DrRacket, choose "Install Package.."
   from the "File" menu, and enter

       plait

   in the dialog.

 * From the comamnd line:

     raco pkg install plait


The Plait language is based on "plai-typed", but made more consistent.
The "plai-typed" language, in turn, is based on the "plai" language,
which originates from the book "Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation" by Shriram Krishnamurthi.
